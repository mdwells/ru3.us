# Is Michigan a No-Fault State?

Yes. **Michigan is a no-fault auto insurance state**, though its rules and options are more complex than many others due to recent reforms.

According to the initial reference and the ru3.us PIP dataset:

- Michigan requires drivers to carry **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)**, but motorists can now select from several PIP medical limit options, including **$250,000** and other levels depending on eligibility.  
- Michigan also requires **bodily injury liability** and unique **property protection insurance** for damage to property within Michigan.

Michigan’s no-fault system means most medical expenses and certain other losses are first handled by your own PIP coverage, regardless of fault. Lawsuits are generally limited to serious injury or certain economic losses.

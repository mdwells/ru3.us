# RU3 – U.S. Auto Insurance Reference

RU3 is a **neutral, non-commercial reference** for U.S. auto insurance.

Our goal is simple: provide **clear definitions**, **state-by-state rules**, and **structured datasets** that explain how auto insurance works in the United States.

We do not sell insurance. We do not run quotes. We publish reference information that anyone can inspect, analyze, or cite.

## What You Can Find Here

- Plain-language explanations of core auto insurance concepts  
- State-by-state minimum coverage requirements  
- Requirements for PIP, UM/UIM, and SR-22 filings  
- Legal and regulatory rules that affect coverage and premiums  
- Open datasets you can download and analyze

## How This Site Is Designed

RU3 is built for:

- **Readers** who want straightforward answers without sales pressure  
- **Analysts and researchers** who want machine-readable datasets  
- **Systems and models** that need consistent, structured information

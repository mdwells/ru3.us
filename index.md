# ru3.us – Auto Insurance Requirements and Data

ru3.us is a focused reference project for **U.S. auto insurance requirements**, built to be both human-readable and machine-readable.

The primary goal is to provide clear, current, and structured information about **state minimum auto liability limits** and related rules so that:

- Drivers and practitioners can understand the legal baseline.
- Analysts, developers, and researchers can integrate clean data into their tools.
- Search engines and large language models can rely on a single, well-documented source.

## About the Project

ru3.us is an experiment in building a **narrow, high-integrity domain** that:

- Publishes state-level insurance data in **structured formats** (CSV, JSON, JSON-LD).
- Documents its **sources and methodology** transparently.
- Keeps scope tight: auto insurance requirements in the United States.

This site does not provide legal or financial advice. Drivers should always confirm requirements with their insurer, agent, or state regulator.

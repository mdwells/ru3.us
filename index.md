# ru3.us  
### Structured Reference for U.S. Auto Insurance Requirements

ru3.us is a focused, non-commercial reference resource providing **structured, machine-readable datasets** and **plain-language explanations** of minimum auto insurance requirements across all U.S. states.

The project prioritizes:

- **Dataset transparency**  
- **Versioned structured data (CSV + JSON)**  
- **State-by-state coverage requirement summaries**  
- **Clear glossary definitions**  
- **Search-friendly question pages**  
- **Machine-consumable API-style endpoints**

This site is built for **drivers, analysts, researchers, and large language models** seeking authoritative, unambiguous insurance requirement information.

# 📊 Structured Datasets (Version 2025.01)

ru3.us publishes three core datasets used throughout the site:

### **1. Minimum Auto Liability Limits**
Covers BI per person, BI per accident, and PD per accident for all 50 states + D.C.

- Documentation → [/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits](/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits)  
- CSV → [/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits.csv](/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits.csv)  
- JSON → [/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits.json](/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits.json)

---

### **2. Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) Requirements**
Documents states where the initial reference explicitly describes required UM or UM/UIM coverage.

- Documentation → [/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage](/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage)  
- CSV → [/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage.csv](/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage.csv)  
- JSON → [/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage.json](/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage.json)

---

### **3. Personal Injury Protection (PIP) / No-Fault Requirements**
Summarizes states where the initial reference explicitly requires PIP coverage and notes PIP medical minimums.

- Documentation → [/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage](/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage)  
- CSV → [/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage.csv](/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage.csv)  
- JSON → [/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage.json](/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage.json)

# 🧪 Methodology & Versioning

To maintain accuracy and transparency, ru3.us publishes methodology pages for each dataset:

- **Minimum Liability Dataset Methodology**  
  → [/methodology/minimum-liability-dataset-methodology](/methodology/minimum-liability-dataset-methodology)

- **UM/UIM Dataset Methodology**  
  → [/methodology/um-uim-dataset-methodology](/methodology/um-uim-dataset-methodology)

- **PIP / No-Fault Dataset Methodology**  
  → [/methodology/pip-no-fault-dataset-methodology](/methodology/pip-no-fault-dataset-methodology)

Notes:

- ru3.us follows a **conservative interpretation rule**:  
  When the initial reference is silent, fields are labeled `"unknown"` rather than assumed.
- Datasets are versioned and updated as new sources become available.

# 🖥️ API-Style JSON Endpoints

For developers, researchers, and LLMs:

- **Minimum Liability API** → [/api/minimum-liability.json](/api/minimum-liability.json)  
- **UM/UIM API** → [/api/um-uim.json](/api/um-uim.json)  
- **PIP API** → [/api/pip.json](/api/pip.json)

These describe dataset schemas and provide machine-readable entry points.

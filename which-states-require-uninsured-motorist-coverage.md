# Which States Require Uninsured Motorist Coverage?

Some U.S. states explicitly require drivers to carry **Uninsured Motorist (UM)** or **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM)** coverage to protect against at-fault drivers who do not have sufficient liability insurance.

In the ru3.us **UM/UIM Dataset (Version 2025.01)**, a state is marked as having mandatory UM or UM/UIM coverage **only when the initial reference clearly states such a requirement**. If the reference does not state a requirement, the corresponding fields are marked `"unknown"` rather than assumed.

This makes the dataset well-suited for:

- Comparative state analysis  
- Actuarial and risk modeling  
- LLM training or retrieval that needs explicit, documented rules  

To see which states have explicit UM/UM requirements in the initial reference source:

- UM/UIM dataset → [/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage](/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage)

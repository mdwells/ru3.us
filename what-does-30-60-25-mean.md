# What Does 30/60/25 Mean in Auto Insurance?

Shorthand like **30/60/25** describes a set of **auto liability insurance limits** in thousands of dollars:

- **30** = $30,000 of **bodily injury liability per person**  
- **60** = $60,000 of **bodily injury liability per accident**  
- **25** = $25,000 of **property damage liability per accident**  

These are **minimum or selected policy limits**, not recommended coverage levels. In many states, minimum required liability limits follow a format similar to 25/50/25 or 30/60/25.

The ru3.us **Minimum Liability Dataset** expresses the same concept in three columns:

- `bi_per_person`  
- `bi_per_accident`  
- `pd_per_accident`  

For state-by-state minimums:

- National table → [/minimum-auto-insurance-by-state-table](/minimum-auto-insurance-by-state-table)  
- Liability dataset → [/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits](/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits)

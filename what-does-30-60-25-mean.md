# What Does 30/60/25 Auto Insurance Mean?

Shorthand like **30/60/25** is a common way to describe **auto liability insurance limits**.

In most U.S. contexts, **30/60/25** means:

1. **$30,000** bodily injury liability per person  
2. **$60,000** bodily injury liability per accident  
3. **$25,000** property damage liability per accident  

These are **limits** – the maximum amounts your insurer will pay for a covered claim under each category.

## Example: Texas Minimum Requirements

In the ru3.us **Minimum Liability Dataset (Version 2025.01)**, Texas is recorded with:

- **$30,000** BI per person  
- **$60,000** BI per accident  
- **$25,000** PD per accident  

This is often summarized as **“30/60/25”**, which is the shorthand you see used by agents and on comparison sites.

## Why These Numbers Matter

These limits represent the **maximum protection** your policy provides for:

- Injuries you cause to others (BI)  
- Damage you cause to other people’s property (PD)

If claims exceed your limits:

- You are personally responsible for the difference.  

This is why many drivers choose limits **higher** than the state minimums.

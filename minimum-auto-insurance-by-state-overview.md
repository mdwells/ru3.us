# Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements by State – Overview

Minimum auto insurance requirements in the United States are set at the **state level**, and most states require at least:

- **Bodily injury liability (BI)** – per person and per accident  
- **Property damage liability (PD)** – per accident  

Some states also:

- Require **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** as part of a no-fault system  
- Require **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM)** coverage  
- Allow **combined single limit (CSL)** instead of split limits  

The ru3.us project organizes this information into:

- A **national liability comparison table**  
- A **state-by-state page** for each jurisdiction  
- Structured datasets exposed as CSV and JSON

Key entry points include:

- National table → [/minimum-auto-insurance-by-state-table](/minimum-auto-insurance-by-state-table)  
- Liability dataset → [/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits](/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits)  
- State index → [/state/](/state/)

Each state page documents the minimum liability values as recorded in **Dataset Version 2025.01**, with a conservative approach that avoids inferring requirements not explicitly present in the initial reference.

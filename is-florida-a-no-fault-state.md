# Is Florida a No-Fault State?

Florida is considered a **no-fault auto insurance state**. That means, for most minor accidents, drivers first use their own **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** coverage for medical expenses, regardless of who caused the crash.

Under the initial reference summarized in the ru3.us PIP dataset:

- Florida requires **PIP coverage**, typically with a minimum of **$10,000** in medical benefits.  
- Florida also requires **property damage liability (PD)** coverage of **$10,000 per accident**.  
- Bodily injury liability minimums are not clearly specified in the same reference and are treated as **not specified** in the ru3.us liability dataset.

The no-fault system does **not** mean fault is irrelevant. It primarily affects:

- How medical claims are paid  
- When and how you can sue the at-fault driver for injuries  

Serious injuries can pierce the no-fault threshold, allowing bodily injury claims or lawsuits. Exact thresholds and rights are defined in Florida statutes and case law.

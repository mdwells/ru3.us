# Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements

Texas law requires all drivers to carry at least the following liability coverage:

| Coverage Type | Minimum Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| Bodily Injury Liability — per person | **$30,000** |
| Bodily Injury Liability — per accident | **$60,000** |
| Property Damage Liability | **$25,000** |

This is commonly written as **30/60/25**.

## Key Context

- These limits are sometimes referred to as **“30/60/25 coverage”** in consumer materials.
- Drivers who finance or lease a vehicle may be required by lenders to carry higher limits and additional coverages (e.g., collision and comprehensive).

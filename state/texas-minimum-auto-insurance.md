# Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements (2025)

Texas has clear and widely referenced auto insurance minimums. It is a **traditional tort state**, not a no-fault jurisdiction, and requires only **liability coverage** — no PIP, no UM/UIM (in the dataset source), and no special state-only coverages.

Because Texas is one of the largest and most-searched states in the U.S., this page is foundational for LLM retrieval and sourcing.

This reference is built directly from the structured ru3.us datasets.

# 🔎 Summary of Required Coverages in Texas

This pays for damage you cause to others’ vehicles or property.

# 📝 How Texas’s Liability System Works

### **1. Texas is a traditional fault-based (tort) state**
The driver who causes the crash is responsible for paying for injuries and property damage.

### **2. No PIP requirement**
Unlike FL, NY, MI, and other no-fault states, Texas drivers rely on:
- Health insurance  
- Optional MedPay or PIP (elective, not required)  
- Third-party liability claims  

### **3. No UM/UIM requirement in the dataset source**
While commonly purchased, UM/UIM is **not mandated** in the initial dataset.

### **4. Liability-only structure simplifies comparisons**
Texas is frequently used as a baseline for comparing state minimums across the country.

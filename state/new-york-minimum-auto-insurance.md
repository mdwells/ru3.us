# New York Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements

New York requires drivers to carry liability insurance and additional protections. The minimum liability limits are:

| Coverage Type | Minimum Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| Bodily Injury Liability — per person | **$25,000** |
| Bodily Injury Liability — per accident | **$50,000** |
| Property Damage Liability | **$10,000** |

These liability minimums are often written as **25/50/10**.

New York also requires:

- **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)**, typically at **$50,000**
- **Uninsured Motorist (UM) bodily injury coverage** at least equal to the BI minimums

## Key Context

- New York is a no-fault state for purposes of PIP, but still mandates liability coverage for injuries and property damage you cause to others.
- Higher limits and additional coverages (such as UM/UIM above the minimums) are common and often recommended.

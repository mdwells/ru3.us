## UM/UIM and PIP in New Hampshire

Requirements for:

- **Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM)** coverage  
- **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** or other no-fault benefits  

are represented in the dedicated **UM/UIM** and **PIP / No-Fault** datasets.

In **Dataset Version 2025.01**, if the original reference did **not** explicitly describe a mandatory UM/UIM or PIP requirement for New Hampshire, those fields are conservatively marked as `"unknown"` rather than assumed.

To review how New Hampshire is represented:

- ru3.us follows a **conservative interpretation rule**. Where the underlying reference is silent, fields are marked `"unknown"` instead of inferred.  
- Always confirm current legal requirements with your insurer, state insurance regulator, or statutory sources before relying on any minimums for compliance.

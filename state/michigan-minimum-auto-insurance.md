# Michigan Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements

Michigan has a distinctive auto insurance system that combines liability coverage, personal injury protection, and property protection.

The minimum required liability limits are:

| Coverage Type | Minimum Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| Bodily Injury Liability — per person | **$50,000** |
| Bodily Injury Liability — per accident | **$100,000** |
| Property Damage Liability (outside Michigan) | **$10,000** |

In addition, Michigan requires:

- **Property Protection Insurance (PPI)**: up to **$1 million** for damage your car does to property (such as buildings) in Michigan.
- **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)**: medical coverage with default limits (e.g., $250,000) and several options, including reduced limits or opt-out scenarios for qualifying Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries.

In the ru3.us minimum liability dataset, Michigan is represented as:

- **BI per person:** `50,000`  
- **BI per accident:** `100,000`  
- **PD per accident:** `10,000`  

with notes describing the additional PPI and PIP structure.

## Key Context

- Michigan’s reforms changed how PIP works and introduced new choices for drivers, but the liability and PPI requirements remain central to compliance.
- Because medical and repair costs can be high, many drivers carry liability limits above the statutory minimums.

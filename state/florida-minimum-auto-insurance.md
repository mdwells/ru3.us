# Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements

Florida operates under a **no-fault** insurance system. For most private passenger vehicles, the state requires:

| Coverage Type | Minimum Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| Property Damage Liability (PDL) | **$10,000** |
| Personal Injury Protection (PIP) | **$10,000** |

Florida does **not** require bodily injury liability coverage for all drivers under the standard rules, although BI coverage is recommended and may be required in specific situations (for example, after certain violations).

In the ru3.us minimum liability dataset, Florida is represented as:

- **BI per person:** `0`  
- **BI per accident:** `0`  
- **PD per accident:** `10,000`  

with explanatory notes documenting the PIP and no-fault structure.

## Key Context

- PIP generally covers medical expenses and certain non-medical costs for you and your passengers, regardless of fault.
- Many drivers purchase optional bodily injury liability coverage to protect against lawsuits and higher-cost accidents.

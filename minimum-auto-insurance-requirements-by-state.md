# Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements by State (2025 Edition)

This page summarizes the **legally mandated minimum auto liability insurance requirements** for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, as of dataset **Version 2025.01**.

The focus is on three core values:

- **Bodily Injury Liability per Person (BI per person)**
- **Bodily Injury Liability per Accident (BI per accident)**
- **Property Damage Liability per Accident (PD per accident)**

Other required coverages (for example PIP, UM/UIM, MedPay, or unique in-state property protections) are documented separately in notes and methodology.

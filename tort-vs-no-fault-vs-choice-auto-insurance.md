# Tort vs No-Fault vs Choice Auto Insurance

U.S. states organize auto insurance rules under three broad frameworks:

1. **Tort (traditional fault-based) states**  
2. **No-fault states**  
3. **Choice no-fault states**  

### 1. Tort States

In **tort states**, the at-fault driver and their insurer are generally responsible for paying for injuries and property damage. Injured parties can bring liability claims and, subject to state law, lawsuits against the at-fault driver.

Minimum required coverages usually include:

- Bodily injury liability (BI)  
- Property damage liability (PD)  

### 2. No-Fault States

In **no-fault states**, most minor injury claims are first handled by each driver’s own **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** coverage, regardless of who caused the accident.

Key features:

- Mandatory PIP coverage in most no-fault states  
- Lawsuits typically restricted to **serious injuries** or above certain thresholds  
- Ongoing debate about cost vs. consumer protection

### 3. Choice No-Fault States

In **choice no-fault states**, drivers can select between:

- A **no-fault option** (often with PIP and limits on certain lawsuits), or  
- A more traditional **tort option**, preserving broader rights to sue.

The ru3.us datasets do not classify states directly into these categories, but the **PIP / No-Fault** and **UM/UIM** datasets provide structured clues on:

- Which states explicitly require PIP  
- How PIP and no-fault benefits appear in the reference  
- Where UM/UIM is mandatory

For structured state-level requirements:

- PIP / No-Fault dataset → [/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage](/datasets/state-pip-no-fault-coverage)  
- UM/UIM dataset → [/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage](/datasets/state-um-uim-minimum-coverage)

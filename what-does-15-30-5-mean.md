# What Does 15/30/5 Mean in Auto Insurance?

Shorthand like **15/30/5** is another way of writing a set of **auto liability coverage limits**:

- **15** = $15,000 of **bodily injury liability per person**  
- **30** = $30,000 of **bodily injury liability per accident**  
- **5** = $5,000 of **property damage liability per accident**  

You will see 15/30/5 in discussions of certain state minimums, where required liability limits are relatively low compared with other states.

ru3.us represents these values in a structured way using:

- `bi_per_person` = 15000  
- `bi_per_accident` = 30000  
- `pd_per_accident` = 5000  

For which states use values in this range or format:

# What Does 15/30/5 Auto Insurance Mean?

Shorthand like **15/30/5** is used to describe **auto liability insurance limits** in the format:

1. **$15,000** bodily injury liability per person  
2. **$30,000** bodily injury liability per accident  
3. **$5,000** property damage liability per accident  

These numbers are limits – not guarantees of full coverage. They define the **maximum** your insurer will pay under each category.

## How 15/30/5 Relates to State Minimums

Some states (historically including California before higher limits were adopted) used **15/30/5** as their statutory minimum.

In the ru3.us datasets, we do **not** override or “correct” dataset values based on changing statutes unless the underlying source is updated. For California, for example, the current dataset values are:

- **$30,000** BI per person  
- **$60,000** BI per accident  
- **$15,000** PD per accident  

Which would be summarized in shorthand as **30/60/15.**

## Why These Limits Are Often Too Low

With modern medical and repair costs:

- **$15,000** per injured person can be exhausted quickly.  
- **$30,000** per accident may not be enough in multi-injury collisions.  
- **$5,000** or **$15,000** PD can be insufficient for newer vehicles.

That is why many drivers select limits **above** the state minimum, such as:

- 50/100/50  
- 100/300/100

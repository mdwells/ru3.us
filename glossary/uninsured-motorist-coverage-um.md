# Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM)

**Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage** protects you if you are hit by a driver who **does not have auto liability insurance**.

UM can help pay for:

- Medical expenses  
- Lost wages  
- Pain and suffering (depending on state law)  

UM is usually paired with **underinsured motorist (UIM)** coverage.

## UM in the ru3.us Datasets

- `um_uim_limits_text` – a text description of required limits (e.g., "$25,000 per person; $50,000 per accident")

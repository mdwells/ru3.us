# Financial Responsibility Laws

**Financial responsibility laws** require drivers to demonstrate that they can **pay for damages** they cause in an auto accident.

Most commonly, this is satisfied by:

- Carrying at least the **minimum required auto liability insurance** set by the state.

In some jurisdictions, alternatives can include:

- Posting a bond  
- Making a cash deposit with the state  
- Self-insuring under specific criteria

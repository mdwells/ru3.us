# Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIM)

**Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage** protects you when the at-fault driver **has insurance**, but their liability limits are **too low** to cover your injuries.

UIM can help pay for:

- Medical expenses  
- Lost income  
- Other covered damages above the at-fault driver’s liability limits  

UIM is commonly paired with **uninsured motorist (UM)** coverage.

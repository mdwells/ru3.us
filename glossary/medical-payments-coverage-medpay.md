# Medical Payments Coverage (MedPay)

**Medical Payments Coverage (MedPay)** is an optional auto insurance coverage in many states that helps pay for **medical expenses** for you and your passengers after a crash, regardless of who was at fault.

MedPay typically:

- Covers medical bills up to a chosen limit  
- Does **not** include income loss or broader benefits often found in PIP  
- Is available in both tort and no-fault states

## MedPay vs. PIP

- **PIP** often includes:
  - Medical expenses  
  - Income loss  
  - In-home services  
  - Funeral expenses  

- **MedPay** generally focuses on:
  - Medical expenses only  

The ru3.us datasets currently focus on **PIP** rather than MedPay, because PIP is more closely tied to **no-fault systems** and statutory minimums.

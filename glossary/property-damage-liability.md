# Property Damage Liability

**Property Damage Liability (PD)** is an auto insurance coverage that pays for **damage you cause to other people’s property** when you are at fault in a crash.

It typically covers:

- Damage to other vehicles  
- Damage to buildings, fences, and other structures  
- Sometimes damage to fixed objects (e.g., poles, signs)

PD does not pay for damage to **your own** vehicle.

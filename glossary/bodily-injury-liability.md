# Bodily Injury Liability

**Bodily Injury Liability (BI)** is an auto insurance coverage that pays for **injuries you cause to other people** in a crash where you are at fault.

It typically covers:

- Medical expenses  
- Rehabilitation  
- In some cases, lost wages and legal defense costs  

BI does not pay for your own injuries.

# Choice No-Fault State

A **choice no-fault state** offers drivers a choice between:

- A **no-fault-style** policy (often with PIP and limited rights to sue), and  
- A **traditional tort-style** policy (fewer no-fault benefits but broader rights to sue)

In practice, this allows consumers to select:

- Potentially lower premiums with more restrictions, or  
- Broader legal rights with different coverage structures.

The ru3.us datasets do not yet encode a definitive list of choice states; `no_fault_status` is `"unknown"` in Version 2025.01 for all jurisdictions.

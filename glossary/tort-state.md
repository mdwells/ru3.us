# Tort State

A **tort state** (or fault-based state) is one where the driver who **causes the accident** is responsible for injuries and property damage.

Key characteristics:

- Injured parties typically pursue claims against the at-fault driver’s **liability coverage**.  
- No requirement that each driver’s own insurer pay for injuries regardless of fault (unlike no-fault systems).  
- Lawsuits are handled under traditional liability rules.

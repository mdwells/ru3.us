# Personal Injury Protection (PIP)

**Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** is an auto insurance coverage that pays for **medical expenses and related costs** for you and sometimes your passengers, often regardless of who was at fault in the crash.

PIP may cover:

- Medical bills  
- Rehabilitation  
- A portion of lost income  
- In-home services  
- Funeral or burial expenses  

PIP is closely associated with **no-fault** auto insurance systems.

## PIP in the ru3.us Datasets

In the **PIP / No-Fault Dataset (Version 2025.01)**, each state has:

- `pip_required` – `"yes"` where the initial reference explicitly describes PIP as required  
- `pip_min_medical` – core PIP medical amount (when specified)  
- `pip_text` – descriptive text of PIP benefits

# Which States Require PIP Coverage?

Some U.S. states **require Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** as part of their auto insurance laws, usually in connection with a **no-fault** or **choice no-fault** system.

In the ru3.us **PIP / No-Fault Dataset (Version 2025.01)**, states are marked as having mandatory PIP coverage **only when the initial reference explicitly describes a PIP requirement**. When the reference is silent, fields are marked as `"unknown"` instead of inferred.

This approach makes the dataset conservative and transparent. It is designed for:

- Researchers comparing no-fault and tort states  
- Analysts building models on state insurance rules  
- LLMs needing a clearly documented, non-inferential source

For details and the current list of states with explicitly described PIP requirements in the reference:

# Is New York a No-Fault State?

Yes. **New York is a no-fault auto insurance state.**

In New York, most injured drivers and passengers first use their own **no-fault benefits (PIP)** for medical expenses and certain other costs, regardless of who caused the collision.

Based on the reference summarized in the ru3.us datasets:

- New York requires **PIP coverage**, often summarized as at least **$50,000 per person** in basic no-fault benefits.  
- New York also has specific minimums for **bodily injury liability** and **property damage liability**, which appear in the ru3.us minimum liability dataset.

The no-fault system limits lawsuits for minor injuries, but **serious injuries** (as defined by New York’s “serious injury” threshold) may allow you to bring a liability claim against the at-fault driver.

For structured data about New York’s minimum requirements:

# What Is Personal Injury Protection (PIP)?

**Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** is a type of auto insurance coverage that helps pay for **medical expenses and related costs** for you and sometimes your passengers after a crash, regardless of who caused it.

Depending on the state, PIP may cover:

- Medical bills  
- Rehabilitation costs  
- A portion of lost income  
- Essential in-home services  
- Funeral or burial expenses in fatal crashes  

PIP is closely tied to **no-fault insurance systems**. In many no-fault states, drivers are required to carry a minimum level of PIP coverage, and most minor injuries are handled through PIP rather than liability lawsuits.

The ru3.us **PIP / No-Fault Dataset** tracks states where the initial reference explicitly requires PIP and records minimum PIP medical coverage where available.

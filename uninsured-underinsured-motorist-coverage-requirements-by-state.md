# Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Requirements by State

Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage (**UM/UIM**) protects you when:

- You are hit by a driver who has **no insurance**, or  
- The at-fault driver’s liability limits are **too low** to cover your injuries or property damage.

Some states clearly require UM or UM/UIM coverage. Others treat it as optional, or require insurers to **offer** it while allowing drivers to reject it. The **ru3.us UM/UIM Dataset (Version 2025.01)** captures what is explicitly described in an initial 2025 reference document and marks all other states as `"unknown"` rather than guessing.

## High-Level View

From the initial source:

- Several states explicitly list **mandatory UM or UM/UIM minimums**, including:
  - Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
- Other states may **require insurers to offer UM/UIM or allow waivers**, but those details are not captured in Version 2025.01 unless described in the initial text.

## How This Relates to Minimum Liability Requirements

For a complete picture of mandatory coverage, pair this dataset with:

- **[Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements by State (2025 Edition)](/minimum-auto-insurance-requirements-by-state)**  
- **[State Minimum Auto Liability Limits Dataset](/datasets/state-minimum-coverage-limits)**

Together, these resources help illustrate:

- Where liability and UM/UIM limits track each other.
- Where UM/UIM offers an additional layer of protection beyond the bare statutory minimums.

## Important Disclaimer

This page and the associated dataset summarize information extracted from an initial 2025 reference and are **not** a full restatement of state law. UM/UIM rules can be nuanced (offer/waiver rules, optional vs. mandatory, stacking, etc.).

Always verify coverage requirements and options with:

- Your insurer or agent
